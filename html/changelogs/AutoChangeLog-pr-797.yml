changes: 
  - rscadd: "Adds Ethereal; a race which lives off of electricity and shines bright. If they are healthy they shine a bright green light, and the more damaged they are, the less they shine and the greyer they become. Their punches do burn damage and they are weak to blunt attacks!
They dont need to eat normal food and dont have nutrition, Instead they gain charge by going into borg rechargers, eating ethereal food or doign specific interactions."
  - refactor: "all nutrition changes now go through a proc so we can override behavior"
