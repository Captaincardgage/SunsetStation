# ADMIN RANK DEFINES                                                                                         #
# The format of this is very simple. Rank name goes first.                                                   #
# Rank is CASE-SENSITIVE, all punctuation save for '-', '_' and '@' will be stripped so spaces don't matter. #
# You can then define permissions for each rank by adding a '=' followed by keywords                         #
# These keywords represent groups of verbs and abilities.                                                    #
# keywords are preceded by a '+', '-' or '*' + adds permissions, - takes them away.							 #
# * is used only with SQL-based admin loading to denote what permissions the rank is allowed to edit		 #
# +@ (or +prev) is a special shorthand which adds all the rights of the rank above it.                       #
# Ranks with no keywords will just be given the most basic verbs and abilities                ~Carn          #
##############################################################################################################
# PLEASE NOTE: depending on config options, some abilities will be unavailable regardless if you have permission to use them!
# If SQL-based admin loading is enabled, ranks and their keywords listed here will be loaded first and override any with the same name loaded from the database.

# Follow the format below when documenting new keywords so the server tools may parse it

# BEGIN_KEYWORDS
# +ADMIN = general admin tools, verbs etc
# +FUN = events, other event-orientated actions. Access to the fun secrets in the secrets panel.
# +BAN = the ability to ban, jobban and fullban
# +STEALTH = the ability to stealthmin (make yourself appear with a fake name to everyone but other admins
# +POSSESS = the ability to possess objects
# +POLL (or +POLL) = the ability to create in game server polls (requires DB)
# +BUILD (or +BUILDMODE) = the ability to use buildmode
# +SERVER = higher-risk admin verbs and abilities, such as those which affect the server configuration.
# +DEBUG = debug tools used for diagnosing and fixing problems. It's useful to give this to coders so they can investigate problems on a live server.
# +VAREDIT = everyone may view viewvars/debugvars/whatever you call it. This keyword allows you to actually EDIT those variables.
# +RIGHTS (or +PERMISSIONS) = allows you to promote and/or demote people.
# +SOUND (or +SOUNDS) = allows you to upload and play sounds
# +SPAWN (or +CREATE) = mob transformations, spawning of most atoms including mobs (high-risk atoms, e.g. blackholes, will require the +FUN flag too)
# +AUTOLOGIN = admin gains powers upon connect. This defaults to on, you can use -AUTOLOGIN to make a role require using the readmin verb to gain powers. (this does not effect the admin's ability to walk past bans or other on-connect limitations like panic bunker or pop limit.)
# +DBRANKS = when sql-based admin loading is enabled, allows for non-temporary changes in the permissions panel to be saved (requires DB)
# +EVERYTHING (or +HOST or +ALL) = Simply gives you everything without having to type every flag

#Admin Rank format is as follows:
#
#Name = Game Admin
#Include = @ ADMIN BAN SOUND
#Exclude = FUN
#Edit =
#
#Name will match anything after '=' and must be identical to an admin's rank in admins.txt to be linked but otherwise has no formatting restrictions.
#A rank's permissions are defined with keywords that control access to groups of verbs and abilities, they are case-sensitive and separated by a space with no prefix.
#To define no permissions for a type, leave it empty.
#There are three types of permissions:
#Include will give a keyword to a rank.
#Exclude removes a keyword and takes precedence over Include.
#Edit will allow an admin to edit these permissions on other ranks or change an admin's rank to another if they can edit all the permissions it has.
#Edit is only used when SQL-based admin loading is enabled.
#If SQL-based admin loading is enabled, ranks and their keywords listed here will be loaded first and override any with the same name loaded from the database.
#
#The following are valid permission keywords:
#ADMIN = general admin tools, verbs etc.
#FUN = events, other event-orientated actions. Access to the fun secrets in the secrets panel.
#BAN = the ability to ban and unban.
#STEALTH = the ability to stealthmin (make yourself appear with a fake name to everyone but other admins.
#POSSESS = the ability to possess objects.
#POLL = the ability to create in game server polls (requires DB).
#BUILD = the ability to use buildmode.
#SERVER = the ability to restart the server, change the game mode or force a round to start/end.
#DEBUG = debug tools used for diagnosing and fixing problems. It's useful to give this to coders so they can investigate problems on a live server.
#VAREDIT = everyone may view viewvars/debugvars/whatever you call it. This keyword allows you to actually EDIT those variables.
#PERMISSIONS = allows you to promote and/or demote people.
#SOUND = allows you to upload and play SOUND.
#SPAWN = mob transformations, spawning of most atoms including mobs (high-risk atoms, e.g. blackholes, will require the +FUN flag too).
#AUTOADMIN = admin gains powers upon connect. This defaults to on, you can exclude AUTOADMIN to make a role require using the readmin verb to gain powers (this does not effect the admin's ability to walk past bans or other on-connect limitations like panic bunker or pop limit).
#DBRANKS = when sql-based admin loading is enabled, allows for non-temporary changes in the permissions panel to be saved (requires DB).
#EVERYTHING = Simply gives you everything without having to type every flag.
#@ = special keyword for the current permission type that adds all the keywords that the preceding rank has of the same type.
